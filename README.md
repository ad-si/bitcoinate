## Goal

Bitcoinate is about enabling people to easily receive bitcoin donations
to fund their projects or to get rewarded for their work.
The core product is a button which can be included into any website
and which displays a bitcoin address to donate to.

Advantages over existing solutions like Kickstarter
or similar crowd funding platforms is that Bitcoinate is decentralized.
That means that users don't have to pay fees
and that they are in full control of the funding campaign.
The long term goal is to establish bitcoins as the currency for crowd funding
and thereby also accelerate the adoption of the digital currency.
